### Overview

Finally, Morpheus aims to provide a standard mechanism to load data from various providers, and the hope is
that this API will be embraced and extended by the community so as to grow the catalogue of available providers. In
the reference implementation, various providers are included to facilitate loading data from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/),
[Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/), [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance),
[The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) and the [Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).
